# Lobby

[User]'s Lobby: [Group]

* `User` is your user name
* `Group` is your lobby's group name

Specify `user` and `group` on the URL
* `.../?group=Lab&user=Scott` creates  _Scott's Lobby: Lab_

* Additional information can be found in the console.

# Remote

* Run the remote application from
  https://arcsjs.web.app/0.4.1/remote/

* The `Group` to join is specified in the settings dialog opened via the Settings button in the right-top corner.
* Enable (or disable) video by clicking the Camera button in the top-left corner.

If the group names match the connections should auto negotiate and the remote video will appear in the Lobby.

Note the remote app will receive no video-stream. The details of the implementation depend on the application, contact sjmiles@google.com.
